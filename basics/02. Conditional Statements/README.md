Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions. This helps your program behave differently depending on the data it receives.
Example: If-Else Python 
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

Explanation:
The if statement checks whether a condition is true. In this case, it checks if age is greater than or equal to 18.
If the condition is true, the code inside the if block runs.
If the condition is false, the code inside the else block runs.
Use elif (short for “else if”) to check multiple conditions.

Why it matters:
Conditional statements let your programs respond differently to different situations, making them dynamic and intelligent.
