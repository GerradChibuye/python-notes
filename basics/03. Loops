Loops are used to repeat tasks automatically without writing the same code multiple times.

i. For Loop

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

Explanation:
The for loop iterates over each item in a sequence (like a list).
fruit is a temporary variable that represents the current item in the list during each iteration.
Every time the loop runs, it prints the current fruit.

ii. While Loop

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1

Explanation:
The while loop repeats as long as the condition (count < 5) is true.
count += 1 increases count by 1 each time, preventing an infinite loop.
Use break to exit a loop early or continue to skip to the next iteration.
Why it matters:
Loops make your code efficient and scalable, especially when dealing with repetitive tasks like processing lists or running calculations multiple times.
