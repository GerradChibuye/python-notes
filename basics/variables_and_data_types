 1. Variables and Data Types in Python

🔹 What Is a Variable? 

A variable is a name used to store data in memory.
Python automatically determines the data type based on the value assigned.

x = 10 name = "Gerrad" 

In Python, you do not need to declare the data type explicitly.

🔹 Rules for Naming Variables 
  - Must start with a letter or underscore (_) 
  - Cannot start with a number
  - Cannot use Python keywords Should be descriptive and meaningful 

✅ Valid:

age = 20 user_name = "Alex" _total = 100 

❌ Invalid:

2name = "John" class = "Math" 🔹 Common Python Data Types 1. Integer (int) 

Whole numbers without decimals.

age = 25 count = 100 2. Float (float) 

Numbers with decimal points.

price = 19.99 temperature = 36.5 3. String (str) 

Text enclosed in quotes.

name = "Gerrad" course = 'Python Programming' 4. Boolean (bool) 

Represents True or False.

is_student = True is_logged_in = False 🔹 Checking a Variable’s Data Type 

Use the type() function:

x = 10 print(type(x)) 

Output:

<class 'int'> 🔹 Multiple Assignment 

You can assign multiple variables at once:

a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 

Or assign the same value:

x = y = z = 0 🔹 Why Variables Matter 

Variables allow programs to:

Store data Perform calculations Make decisions Reuse values efficiently 

They are the foundation of all Python programs.

✨ Key Takeaway 

Understanding variables and data types is essential for writing clear, readable, and reliable Python code.
